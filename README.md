# OpenGL Graphics Engine
Graphics engine that enables loading .obj objects and texturering them with .png files.
Ment for use as a base for other projects. The application is compiled and tested only on OSX.

How to compile and run the application using the terminal:
  1. "mkdir bin"
  2. "make"
  3. "make run"

Or, instead of 2 and 3: "make sense" =)
