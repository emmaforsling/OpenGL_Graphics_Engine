# OpenGL Graphics Engine
Graphics engine that enables loading .obj objects and texturering them with .png files.
Ment for use as a base for other projects. The application is compiled and tested only on OSX.

A default main file can be used to compile and run this application. To run it, move main.cpp into the folder src

How to compile and run the application using the terminal:
  1. "mkdir bin"
  2. "make"
  3. "make run"

Or, instead of 2 and 3: "make sense" =)
